    <p>Codey's Lab ™ is an <strong>Interactive</strong> tutorial system that runs in the Unity Editor and teaches you how to use Unity and C#.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Space Shooter uses the same Assets as the official Unity tutorial. However, the tutorial will take you through the code and explain every word and phrase.</p>
    <p>You will be guided through each step so that you can create a whole game from Empty scene to Ready-to-Publish game.</p>

    <p>This Asset is the Entire Space Shooter course that has been finished up to this point. (Only Chapters 1-2 are done.)</p>
    <p>This asset will <strong>include all future chapters</strong> to the Space Shooter course <strong>without any additional purchases</strong>.</p>
    <p>We will increase the price each time we add another chapter, so <strong>if you buy it now, you will save money</strong>.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The planned future updates are below, and we will likely add more beyond this.</p>
    <p><em>Note: You are only actually paying for Chapter 2 and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete the additional chapters. This statement is here in case we get sick or die or something like that, etc. You know, because we cannot foresee the future of this timeline.</em></p>
    <p>With that said, it is highly likely we will publish Chapter 3 in the next few weeks, and you will get a great value by buying it now.</p>
    <p><strong>Extremely Insane Awesome Bonus Value:</strong> By purchasing Codey's Lab ™ you get genuine warm fuzzy feelings for helping Indie developers like you to feed their family. (In fact, let's all help our fellow developers and buy more assets!)</p>
